# 🌫️ Predicting Air Quality Using Neural Networks

## 📌 Project Overview

Air pollution is one of the most critical environmental and public health challenges today. This project focuses on **analyzing and predicting Air Quality Index (AQI)** values for multiple Indian cities using **data analysis, visualization, and a Neural Network model**.

The notebook performs:

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Visualization of AQI trends and distributions
* Feature preprocessing
* AQI prediction using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

The goal is to understand air quality patterns and build a predictive model that can estimate AQI based on historical data.

---

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains historical air quality data with the following key features:

* **Date** – Observation date
* **City** – Name of the city
* **AQI** – Air Quality Index value
* **Air Pollutants** – PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, O₃ (where available)

Multiple Indian cities are included to enable comparative analysis and trend visualization.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used

* **Python**
* **NumPy & Pandas** – Data manipulation and preprocessing
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Static visualizations
* **Plotly** – Interactive visualizations
* **Scikit-learn** – Scaling, train-test split
* **TensorFlow / Keras** – Neural Network model

## ⚠️ Important Note About Plotly Graphs (GitHub Limitation)

This project uses **Plotly** for interactive visualizations.

🔴 **GitHub does NOT render interactive Plotly graphs inside Jupyter notebooks.**
As a result:

* Plotly graphs **will NOT appear dynamically on GitHub**
* The notebook code is correct, but GitHub has rendering limitations

### ✅ Solutions Implemented

* Key visualizations are **exported as PNG images**
* PNG images are displayed in this README for easy viewing

### 🔄 To View Interactive Graphs:

1. Clone/download the repository
2. Open the notebook (`.ipynb`) locally
3. Run the notebook in **VS Code / Jupyter Notebook**
4. Interactive Plotly graphs will render correctly
