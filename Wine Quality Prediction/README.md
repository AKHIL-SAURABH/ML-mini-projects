# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

Wine Quality Prediction is a **machine learning classification project** that aims to predict the **quality of wine** based on its **physicochemical properties** such as acidity, alcohol content, pH level, sulphates, and more.

The project demonstrates a **complete ML workflow** — from data analysis and preprocessing to training multiple models and evaluating their performance.
