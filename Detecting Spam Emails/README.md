# 📧 Detecting Spam Emails using TensorFlow

This mini project focuses on building a **Spam Email Detection system** using **Deep Learning** techniques in Python. The goal is to classify emails as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** based on their textual content.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Spam emails are unsolicited messages that can be harmful or misleading. In this project, we use **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and a **Neural Network model** built with TensorFlow to automatically detect spam emails with high accuracy.

## 🧠 Approach Used

* Text preprocessing and cleaning
* Tokenization and sequence padding
* Binary classification using a neural network
* Model training and evaluation

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **TensorFlow / Keras**
* **NumPy**
* **Pandas**
* **Scikit-learn**
* **NLTK**
* **Matplotlib**

---

## 📂 Dataset

* A labeled dataset containing email text classified as:

  * `spam`
  * `ham`
* Data is loaded from a CSV file and split into training and testing sets.

---

## 🏗️ Model Details

* Text tokenization using `Tokenizer`
* Sequence padding for uniform input length
* Neural Network with:

  * Embedding Layer
  * Dense Layers
* Binary classification using **sigmoid activation**

---

## 📊 Results

* The model successfully learns patterns in spam emails
* Performance evaluated using:

  * Accuracy
  * Training & validation metrics
