    "\n",
    "**Sentiment Analysis** is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique used to determine the emotional tone behind a body of text. It is widely used in analyzing user opinions on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and online reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mini project, we demonstrate how sentiment analysis can be performed on text data using **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**. The project covers essential NLP steps including tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, and sentiment scoring using the VADER sentiment analyzer."

it i had no trouble raising kids without a kindle whatever enhancements it can add to the experience do not negate books entirely a child would rather page through a colorful book and enjoy going back

hard copy books entirely  it just provides a level of useflness that outdoes hardcopy books hands down jogging on the treadmill holding a baby at the beachin the water with a protective case and then all the places and situations you could still read a regular book but instead youve got your whole library in oz and in one hand oh not to mention you can bookmark highlight add notes and you have a

best gifts i have ever received i love my kindle\\n i received my kindle as a gift and appreciate the thought i have a large collection of books in my home have always been an avid reader and enjoy sharing and trading them its less expensive the kindle is good for travel or other situations where it may be easier than carrying a book im glad to see people actually discussing and  sharing their ideas yes its the kindle site but im not an amazon rep restricted to advertising the product and avoiding discussion of its pros and cons  it has many good points but theres room for improvement this is a good place to voice concerns and suggestions from which other readers may benefit  for me reading for too long off the kindle gives me a headache and  the  clip on light mentioned by somebody causes glare on my screen and eyestrain  despite angle adjustments the effects are similar to  staring at a computer screen at length if anyone has suggestions on how to correct this this forum is the

favor of sending them anything  sorry\\nreport profile views tracker as spam so we dont have to put up with this all the time\\na great articlea great ideasomebody should be sending kindles to the poverty stricken regions of the globe i love it\\ngreat story  and he has a point\\nlets make them solar powered first\\nandrea that was my point too lol  im sure the purpose is to help people read if they were only donated to people who already know how to read then lets donate them to everyone\\ni think sending the developing world kindles would be an awesome idea it could help them learn to read there are dictionaries on it to help and they could communicate with people all over the world with facebook i am posting this from my kindle  d\\noh a solar powered kindle would be great  not only for developing countries but for our own too  can you imagine not having to worry about losing the charger cable ever again\\ni too just returned from india  southern india and the children were fascinated by the kindle a very poor country where the people work harder than i have ever seen people work while i love my kindle and think they to would love and enjoy one  they couldnt afford the cost of books or internet the average salary is us dollars a day\\nit would also be great it the average us citizen could afford them kindles are awesome but i work  jobs and i cant afford one\\nsend my son a kindle and load his school books on it to relieve his frame of carrying home  pounds of books and binder daily\\nseriously margaret do we just assume now that anyone in the ghettos of the world aka developing countries cant read as if your capitalized sentence didnt ooze sarcasm how could you think that wasnt rude\\nwhile there are issues to work out power etc this was a very well written essay and i commend the writer for it  capturing the essence of a powerful experience is what world travel is all about\\nkaren god forbid your son should have to exorcise a bit they want to give kindles do people who have nothing and youre complaining about your son you want to be obese\\nid like to buy the world a cokeand a kindle \\nunfortunately i agree with karen on the overly heavy schoolbooks comment however they make kindle formats of many textbooks now so hopefully that will alleviate that stress soon  as for sending kindles to the modernizing world i believe it would be a great idea in theory and probably a horrible idea in practice  i also believe there are greater concerns in those countries that we need to tackle first before sending them kindles\\n cj  because that is what i do professionallyworking for programs that teach illiterate adults here and abroad  and in the developing countries most of the adults are functionally illiteratenot their fault  the capitalized sentence wasnt to ooze sarcasm at the people but at the idea we can send technology and it will all magically be better  trust me on this  learning to read as an adult is hard work and only happens with lots of work by the teacherstutors and the students\\ni think its interesting that there are so many that assume people in developing countries go not read did anyone read the post one of the kids was more excited about reading off the kindle then playing around with it what i took is that the kindle has the potential to renew the interest of the reader and create some excitement that for now a traditional book is lacking\\n john tapley carrying books around causing back issues has nothing to do with exercise if doing so made kids less fat then why would there be fat youths still get over yourself textbooks on kindles would be great not so great for irresponsible kids which is nearly all of them\\nget a better back pack and quit whining about the fact that school kids have to carry books\\n john tapley carrying books around causing back issues has nothing to do with exercise if doing so made kids less fat then why would there be fat youths still get over yourself textbooks on kindles would be great not so great for irresponsible kids which is nearly all of them\\nget a better back pack and quit whining about the fact that school kids have to carry books\\nwhat a delightful and joyful article i was in a very smart restaurant in goa about  months ago reading my kindle  the guy at the next table got out his ipad for nothing seemingly more than a bit of showing off the waiters were fascinated by the kindle and all wanted to play with it they ignored the ipad\\nwhat a brilliant article and idea   i love my kindle and learn something new every day i read it  the dictionary would be so helpful and the text to speech would help in learning to read  brilliant\\ngod what a great idea with the need for books being so profound in the developing world kindles could be the answer\\nthis would certainly benefit amazon lolbut really it would be an inexpensive way to spread the wisdom of books\\nagree agree agree if i could like this post a million times i would teach a man to fish not sell crap on ebay \\none of my sons has dyslexia i would read books required for high school english into a tape recorder and he would listen to them a kindle would have saved so much time what a blessing technology is this is an amazing tool for dyslexics\\nnot just developing countries  of the american population is functionally illiterate we have highschool graduates who can not read their diplomas does it get worse than that\\nid rather send comdomsor the pill\\nexactly right dragana\\nstop buying textbooks for kids in school give them kindles\\nthey would benefit from decent medication food and contraception first before a kindle\\nid like to see kindles donated to low income families and schools in the united states as well there are children who dont have access to books everywhere\\nerica pentz yes fantastic idea\\nim going to agree with margaret on this one the fact is that reading is a learned skill and there are many countries which havent yet learned it its just plain ignorant to think that there arent people who dont have this skill and about the backpacks and textbooks on the kindle its really an issue of publishers and copyrights and softwarehardware issues a device like dare i utter it here the ipad would be able to handle such a purpose far better \\nvery interesting  \\nwait briwe can go on fb on

opened again with the font changing option i have been a walking advertisement several times personally kindle needs to direct advertise to ophthalmologists\\nhow about sending this usa struggling

that was a great article there is way too much tearing things apart instead of looking at the intent of the article\\nneed to know how to share books\\nwhy give things away why not offer it to them at a price they can afford giving low income families kindles may sound nice but how about offering a work for a kindle program where low income teens and adults alike could do things like work in a soup kitchen help clean up parks and clean graffiti from public areas for x amount of hours in exchange for a kindlethat way they would have pride in knowing they earned it and it would prevent most of them from selling it for cash\\ncreate source of income first jackass how do u propose they pay for the books the wanna read when they can hardly afford foodthese people are dining from hunger and
