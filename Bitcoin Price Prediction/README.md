# 📈 Bitcoin Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

Bitcoin is one of the most volatile and widely traded cryptocurrencies in the world. Predicting its price movement is a challenging task due to market uncertainty, investor sentiment, and external economic factors.

In this project, **Machine Learning models** are used to analyze historical Bitcoin price data and predict future price trends. The notebook demonstrates a complete **end-to-end ML workflow**, starting from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze historical Bitcoin price data
* Perform feature engineering for time-series prediction
* Train multiple Machine Learning models
* Compare model performance using evaluation metrics
* Predict Bitcoin price movement (Up / Down)

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

The project follows a structured ML pipeline:

1. **Data Collection**

   * Historical Bitcoin price dataset is loaded and explored

2. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Handling missing values
   * Feature selection
   * Date-based transformations

3. **Feature Engineering**

   * Creating target labels for price movement
   * Preparing data for supervised learning

4. **Model Building**

   * Logistic Regression
   * Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   * XGBoost Classifier

5. **Model Evaluation**

   * Accuracy Score
   * Confusion Matrix
   * Comparative performance analysis

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains historical Bitcoin market information such as:

* Open price
* Close price
* High price
* Low price
* Volume
* Date

These features are used to learn patterns and trends in Bitcoin price movement.

## 🚀 Models Implemented

| Model                        | Purpose                                |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Logistic Regression          | Baseline classification model          |
| Support Vector Machine (SVM) | Handles non-linear decision boundaries |
| XGBoost Classifier           | High-performance ensemble model        |

---

## 📈 Results & Observations

* Ensemble models like **XGBoost** performed better than traditional models
* Feature engineering significantly impacted model accuracy
* ML models can identify short-term Bitcoin price movement trends but are **not financial advice**

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is **for educational purposes only**.
Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, and predictions made by ML models should **not** be used for real-world trading decisions.
