# 📊 Sales Forecast Prediction

This project focuses on predicting future sales using historical sales data through data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning models. Sales forecasting plays a crucial role in business decision-making, inventory planning, and demand estimation.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

The notebook demonstrates a **step-by-step implementation** of a sales prediction system:

* Understanding and preparing raw sales data
* Converting sales data into a time-series format
* Visualizing sales trends
* Training regression-based machine learning models
* Evaluating prediction performance

---

## 🧠 Workflow Implemented

1. **Importing Required Libraries**

   * Data handling, visualization, and machine learning libraries are imported.

2. **Dataset Loading**

   * Sales data is loaded from a CSV file (`train.csv`) containing order and sales information.

3. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Date conversion and aggregation of daily sales
   * Handling time-series structure
   * Feature selection and preparation for modeling

4. **Data Visualization**

   * Sales trends are visualized using line plots to understand patterns and seasonality.

5. **Model Building**

   * Regression-based models are trained for sales forecasting.
   * Train-test split is applied to evaluate model performance.

6. **Model Evaluation**

   * Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used to measure prediction accuracy.
