# 🐦 Twitter Sentiment Analysis

A Machine Learning–based mini project that analyzes tweets and classifies them into **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** sentiments using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Social media platforms like Twitter generate massive amounts of user opinions every day. This project focuses on extracting insights from tweets by performing **sentiment analysis**, helping understand public opinion, trends, and emotional tone behind textual data.

The complete workflow is implemented in a **Jupyter Notebook**, covering data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
